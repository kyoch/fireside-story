    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>It was too scary for me</p>
    <p>My dog Chance was hiding in my closet. He hates storms.</p>
    <p>regardless,throwing a log into the fireplace lightened the room.
       And some <a href="www.pandora.com">relaxing music</a> always helps. Chance started barking. Somebody was knocking on the door. Who would that be in this hour?
